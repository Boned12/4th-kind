[I watched the last stone leave my hand, gracing the water with a simple
dive, free of confusion. My love long past deserved contemplation never
concentration.]{style="color:white"}

["Am I cable of rest"]{style="color:white"}

[Knowing well sleeping at the time were sinful]{style="color:white"}

["Maybe a break will do us well"]{style="color:white"}

[knowing my heart had fallen ill and her Rhythm]{style="color:white"}

[dragged me down past the waves ]{style="color:white"}

[My hand tight ]{style="color:white"}

[Just to crash. She muted her symbol]{style="color:white"}

[ ]{style="color:white"}

[The path was wide enough to fit four men,]{style="color:white"}

[Ten of my size.]{style="color:white"}

[Yet]{style="color:white"}

[those dimples took their place,]{style="color:white"}

[blurred lines ]{style="color:white"}

[and space ]{style="color:white"}

[became indivisible. ]{style="color:white"}

[bloodshot she held face ]{style="color:white"}

["Let her be mine and i\'ll be alright, simple" ]{style="color:white"}

[but my sound ached for a living ]{style="color:white"}

[My mind like her body]{style="color:white"}

[Would sway and shake ]{style="color:white"}

[thighs wide ,shut, and me stuck in the middle.]{style="color:white"}

[Our steps closed only on the fifth]{style="color:white"}

[Her eyes bounced around this inlet]{style="color:white"}

[managed to catch me adrift.]{style="color:white"}

***[I had ne'er seen anyone walk like that ]{style="color:white"}***

***[, neither drunk nor sober.]{style="color:white"}***

[eyes that told tales long and shroud]{style="color:white"}

[I watched her spin ]{style="color:white"}

[rotate her lips]{style="color:white"}

["WHERE to rockerboy" she passed]{style="color:white"}

[and i failed to keep on going]{style="color:white"}

[Stuck like a dog to her hip.]{style="color:white"}

[I tried to give her a bit ]{style="color:white"}

["Here and there, honestly all around",]{style="color:white"}

["Oh up and down, stuck in town" ]{style="color:white"}

[I let it slip ]{style="color:white"}

[The sort of laughter that made your soul ]{style="color:white"}

[feel a chip, how much of her]{style="color:white"}

[Was this? ]{style="color:white"}

[Say, if we worked together ]{style="color:white"}

[I would wonder why people didn\'t tip.]{style="color:white"}

[ ]{style="color:white"}

["You play?" my heart just finished a clip]{style="color:white"}

[Beating like bongos, my music, our type of shit.]{style="color:white"}

[She said "Let me tell you this,]{style="color:white"}

[You sound like rain]{style="color:white"}

[ in the okavango]{style="color:white"}

[passionate and sick"]{style="color:white"}

["I don\'t know much about those plains, but ]{style="color:white"}

[I admire your riff]{style="color:white"}

[To me the words you lift ]{style="color:white"}

[Are too sweet to be leftover ]{style="color:white"}

[Rain comes some days]{style="color:white"}

[But you, the Heat ]{style="color:white"}

[reign all over" ]{style="color:white"}

[A queen if i ever met one ]{style="color:white"}

[A scene if i ever set one]{style="color:white"}

[Novel, Some reading i\'ll never get]{style="color:white"}

[Done.]{style="color:white"}
