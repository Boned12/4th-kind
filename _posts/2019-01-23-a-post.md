I watched the last stone leave my hand, gracing the water with a simple  
dive, free of confusion. My love long past deserved contemplation never  
concentration.

"Am I cable of rest"

Knowing well sleeping at the time were sinful

"Maybe a break will do us well"

knowing my heart had fallen ill and her Rhythm

dragged me down past the waves

My hand tight

Just to crash. She muted her symbol

The path was wide enough to fit four men,

Ten of my size.

Yet

those dimples took their place,

blurred lines

and space

became indivisible.

bloodshot she held face

"Let her be mine and i'll be alright, simple"

but my sound ached for a living

My mind like her body

Would sway and shake

thighs wide ,shut, and me stuck in the middle.

Our steps closed only on the fifth

Her eyes bounced around this inlet

managed to catch me adrift.

***I had ne'er seen anyone walk like that***

***, neither drunk nor sober.***

eyes that told tales long and shroud

I watched her spin

rotate her lips

"WHERE to rockerboy" she passed

and i failed to keep on going

Stuck like a dog to her hip.

I tried to give her a bit

"Here and there, honestly all around",

"Oh up and down, stuck in town"

I let it slip

The sort of laughter that made your soul

feel a chip, how much of her

Was this?

Say, if we worked together

I would wonder why people didn't tip.

"You play?" my heart just finished a clip

Beating like bongos, my music, our type of shit.

She said "Let me tell you this,

You sound like rain

in the okavango

passionate and sick"

"I don't know much about those plains, but

I admire your riff

To me the words you lift

Are too sweet to be leftover

Rain comes some days

But you, the Heat

reign all over"

A queen if i ever met one

A scene if i ever set one

Novel, Some reading i'll never get

Done.
